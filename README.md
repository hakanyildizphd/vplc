# vplc

This project contains a *vpl_evaluate.sh* script implemented in Python 3, with its supporting elements, which grades a C/C++ homework by running it against inputs.

The script is expected to be configured by changing the definitions at the beginning. For compilated grading, one is also expected to implement a checker program.

The project focuses on ease of grading and informativeness, yet it does not offer reliability to the full extent. Please, have an understanding of how the script works and carefully evaluate the implications before using this script in your environment.

The software is shared under the MIT license. See the LICENSE file for details.
