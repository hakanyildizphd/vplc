This project contains a *vpl_evaluate.sh* script implemented in Python 3, which can be used to grade C/C++ homeworks in black-box fashion on the Moodle VPL plugin.

The script is expected to be configured by changing the definitions at the beginning. For complicated grading, one is also expected to implement a checker program. Some basic checkers and supporting tools are already provided in the project.

The project prioritizes ease of grading and informativeness. It does not offer isolation and reliability to the full extent. Please, have an understanding of how the script works and carefully evaluate the implications before using this script in your environment.

The software is shared under the MIT license. See the LICENSE file for details.
